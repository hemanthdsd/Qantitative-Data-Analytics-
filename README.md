## Assignments

### 1. **Usability and Workload Analysis in Voice User Interfaces**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the relationship between usability (measured by the System Usability Scale, SUS) and perceived workload (measured by the NASA Task Load Index, RTLX) in voice user interfaces.
   - **Key Insights**:
     - A significant positive correlation (r = 0.6899, p < 0.001) was observed between SUS and RTLX scores.
     - Unexpected finding: Increased usability correlates with increased workload.
     - Techniques used: Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualization (histograms, scatterplots), and Pearson's correlation.
   - **Files**:
     - `Assignment1/Assignment_DSD.R`: R script for data analysis.
     - `Assignment1/SusRtlx.csv`: Dataset containing SUS and RTLX scores.
     - `Assignment1/Assignment_Poster_DSD.pdf`: Poster summarizing research and findings.

### 2. **Exploration of Advertising Effectiveness Through Statistical Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Examine the impact of various factors (e.g., demographics, channel preferences) on the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
   - **Key Insights**:
     - Evaluated statistical relationships to identify factors driving campaign success.
     - Applied regression modeling, hypothesis testing, and visualization to derive actionable insights.
   - **Files**:
     - `Assignment2/Assignment_Ads.R`: R script for analysis of advertising data.
     - `Assignment2/AdCampaignData.csv`: Dataset containing advertising metrics and demographic details.
     - `Assignment2/Assignment_Poster_Ads.pdf`: Summary presentation of the findings.
