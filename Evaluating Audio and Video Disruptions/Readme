Tetris Gameplay Analysis: Impact of Visual and Auditory Interruptions

Description
This repository contains the analysis, data, and findings of a study examining the effects of visual and auditory interruptions on Tetris gameplay performance. The research investigates how these interruptions influence task performance, cognitive load, and user focus. The study highlights that auditory interruptions are less disruptive than visual interruptions, leading to better gameplay scores.

Files in the Repository
1. Rcode_assignment_2.R
Purpose: Main R script for data analysis and visualization.
Key Features:
Data cleaning to ensure scores remain within valid ranges (0-100).
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
Visualization of performance data (box plots, mean comparison graphs).
Statistical hypothesis testing using Welch’s t-test.
2. tetris.csv
Description: Dataset containing gameplay scores for 64 participants.
Columns:
Condition: Type of interruption (Auditory or Visual).
Score: Tetris gameplay performance scores (0-100).
3. Assignment-2_QDA_Poster.pdf
Description: Poster summarizing the study's methodology, results, and key takeaways.
Highlights:
Methodology: A between-participants design comparing two interruption conditions.
Results:
Auditory interruptions: Mean score = 67.94 ± 11.05.
Visual interruptions: Mean score = 46.62 ± 11.80.
Statistically significant difference observed (p < 0.001).
Discussion: Implications for designing user interfaces and managing interruptions effectively.
Statistical Methods Used
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range.
Normality Tests: Shapiro-Wilk test for distribution assessment.
Variance Equality: Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances.
Hypothesis Testing: Welch’s t-test to compare auditory and visual interruption conditions.
Data Visualization: Box plots and mean comparison graphs for clearer insights.

Findings Summary
Descriptive Statistics:
Auditory interruptions: Mean = 67.94, SD = 11.05.
Visual interruptions: Mean = 46.62, SD = 11.80.
Key Insight:
Auditory interruptions are less disruptive than visual ones, leading to higher performance scores.
Future Research Directions
Investigate the effects of combined auditory and visual interruptions.
Study interruption impact over extended gameplay sessions.
